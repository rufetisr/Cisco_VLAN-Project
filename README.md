Cisco VLAN Configuration with Trunking
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrating VLAN configuration and trunking between two switches.

Project Description
The project involves the creation of two VLANs (VLAN 10 and VLAN 11) and the configuration of trunking between two Cisco switches. The setup is designed to show how VLANs can segment network traffic and communicate across multiple switches using a trunk link.

Two VLANs:
VLAN 10: Hosts PC0, PC1, PC5, and PC6
VLAN 11: Hosts PC2, PC3 and PC7

Two Switches:
2960-24TT switches are used to interconnect the devices.

Trunk Link:
A trunk link between the switches is configured using 802.1Q tagging to allow VLAN traffic to pass between them.
